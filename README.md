We support a number of Windows 10 client computers oversees using Intune. As these computers are not on an on-premises active directory domain and there is no SCCM service available the administration with Intune is a lot more limited. For this reason I have created this repository of simple Powershell scripts which can be used to perform admin tasks. These might also be useful to deploy using SCCM if you need to make admin changes and group policy is not an option.
